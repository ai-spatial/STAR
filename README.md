Learning for data with heterogeneity (ICDM'21 Best Paper Award)

This repository includes several versions of the framework for different types of machine learning models, organized by different folders:
* [Deep-learning-models](Deep-learning-models): Fully-connected, convolutional, recurrent, ...
* [Tree-based-models](Tree-based-models): Random forest
* **Demo and model-specific ReadMe available in the two folders.**
