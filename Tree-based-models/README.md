The code is now a standalone version for random forest without inherited tensorflow functions from the deep learning version.

Further updates are being incorporated to further simplify the use of the code and additional tutorials will be added.

It is recommended to run the model on multi-core machines to maximize the efficiency for random forest models. There is a parameter setting in paras.py that allows customized number of cores.
